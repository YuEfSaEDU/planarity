# Planarity

The [`planarity` repository](https://github.com/graph-algorithms/planarity)
provides the source code for the [`planarity` Python
package](https://pypi.org/project/planarity/). The `planarity` package was
originally developed to provide Python and
[NetworkX](https://pypi.org/project/networkx/) developers with a Python API to
access planar graph testing, embedding, drawing, and forbidden subgraph
isolation algorithms from the [Edge Addition Planarity Suite
(EAPS)](https://github.com/graph-algorithms/edge-addition-planarity-suite).

The `planarity` repository has now been transferred to the [Github Graph
Algorithms Organization](https://github.com/graph-algorithms). The `planarity`
repository and Python package have been updated with the full set of
planarity-related algorithms from
[EAPS](https://github.com/graph-algorithms/edge-addition-planarity-suite) as
well as all public methods from its generalized graph library to enable
development of a wide range of high-performance graph algorithms and
applications.

## Example

```python
In [1]: # Example of the complete graph of 5 nodes, K5, which is not planar.

In [2]: import planarity

In [3]: edgelist = [('Amsterdam', 'Beijing'), ('Amsterdam', 'Chicago'), ('Amsterdam', 'Delhi'), ('Amsterdam', 'Esmeraldas'),
                    ('Beijing', 'Chicago'),('Beijing', 'Delhi'),('Beijing', 'Esmeraldas'),
                    ('Chicago', 'Delhi'), ('Chicago', 'Esmeraldas'),
                    ('Delhi', 'Esmeraldas')]

In [4]: print(planarity.is_planar(edgelist))
False

In [5]: # Remove an edge to make the graph planar

In [6]: edgelist.remove(('Amsterdam', 'Beijing'))

In [7]: print(planarity.is_planar(edgelist))
True

In [8]: # Show the mapping of node indexes to their original labels

In [9]: print(planarity.mapping(edgelist))
{1: 'Amsterdam', 2: 'Beijing', 3: 'Chicago', 4: 'Delhi', 5: 'Esmeraldas'}

In [10]: # Draw the graph as text

In [11]: print(planarity.ascii(edgelist))
```

```python

```

"Matplotlib render of $K_5$-minus-edge")

Note that the removed edge `('Amsterdam', 'Beijing')` corresponds to edge `(1, 2)` using vertex indexes.
